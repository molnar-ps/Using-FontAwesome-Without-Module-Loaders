# Using-FontAwesome-Without-Module-Loaders

I created this repository so that people can learn from my mistake of an Issue I opened [on one of FontAwesome's GitHub repositories](https://github.com/FortAwesome/react-fontawesome/issues/211).

Also you could use this as a little boilerplate for whatever you find a need for.
